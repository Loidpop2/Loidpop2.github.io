        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first off, if you're reading this, I'm surprised you're poking around the site this much! Anyways, let me tell you a bit about who I am.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a 15 year old software engineer in highschool, knowing HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C#, Java, Python, and a few others here and there. I grew up with computers in my life since I was around 8 or 9 years old, coding on Scratch and becoming familiar with Linux early on. I switched to Unity when I was about 10, maybe 11 years old, then kept expanding my skills from there on. I picked up on generic C#- things like Dotnet, not Unity- only to then realize that there's thousands, if not millions of coding languages out there. I started working with Python a lot, specifically PYQT5, and made a lot of minigames with it. I picked up on HTML after that, once I realized PYQT was just HTML and CSS, then started researching ways to host websites. Give it time, and soon enough I start using GitHub and find out how their Pages module works. Picked up JavaScript and started making websites, learned Java to make simpler Minecraft mods, and started to really grasp the coding world at about 12, maybe 13 years old.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that's my backstory. If you want to check out my latest projects that I shared, search for "Test" in the <a href="/blogs/">Blogs</a> section- anything with that word is something like a new API represented in something equivalent to a "Hello World" app. I probably won't end up updating too many blogs, but I'll definitely be adding more. Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this. Truly, it means a lot.</p>
