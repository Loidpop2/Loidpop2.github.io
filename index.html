        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, reader. You've stumbled upon my website. This shows a preview of my skills. I'm a small time indie game dev, and a website developer. I'm in 9th grade at Caldera High, Bend, Oregon, and take part in many classes important to my carreer, such as business, computer science, and more. Hope you enjoy!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy coding small websites, video games and tools for little hobbies, because It's a great creative outlet. I'm able to put what I want to happen in code, and watch it happen exactly how I told it to, with theoretically infinite potential complexity. I love games like Elden Ring, Risk of Rain and many more, all because they show this well. Many popular companies work with teams of people, but I like to work by myself, that way I can choose what I want to happen in all ways possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for taking time to check this out! If you've gotten this far, you must find some of my works a little interesting. That's awesome! I'm always open to feedback, too, if you want to check out the <a href="/contact/">Contact</a> page!</p>
